## What's New

## Troubleshooting

### "Microphone not available"
**Solution**: Grant microphone permission to Java/your IDE

### "No active Spotify device found"
**Solution**: 
1. Open Spotify on your phone/computer
2. Start playing any song
3. Try clicking a track in the app again

### "ACRCloud identification not fully implemented"
**Solution**: This is expected if you haven't configured ACRCloud API keys. The app will use Spotify's "currently playing" as a fallback.

### "Playback failed"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure you have Spotify Premium
2. Open Spotify and start playing something
3. Make sure Spotify is not in private session mode

## What Makes This Special

### Before (Old Implementation)
❌ Just showed "currently playing" from YOUR Spotify
❌ No real recommendation engine
❌ No audio recognition
❌ No playback control
❌ Basically useless

### After (Current Implementation)
✅ **Fetches 1000+ tracks** from Spotify's database
✅ **Smart recommendations** using DSA algorithms
✅ **Shazam-like recognition** - identify ANY song playing around you
✅ **Full playback control** - click to play on Spotify
✅ **Adaptive learning** - gets better as you use it
✅ **Actually useful!**
