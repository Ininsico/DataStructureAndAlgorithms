# 🚨 ACRCLOUD ISSUE - READ THIS!

## The Problem

**Your ACRCloud credentials are INVALID or EXPIRED.**

The API keys you provided:
```
Access Key: e582fe76e4a4c02117e4056c10da736c
Secret Key: SXe3gZz5SQZp1GrBQFTv1sVYDIOpWWOEVxeb2POV
```

Are being **REJECTED** by ACRCloud servers with error: `Missing/Invalid Access Key`

## The Solution (2 Options)

### ✅ Option 1: Use Spotify Fallback (WORKS NOW!)

**The app ALREADY works without ACRCloud!** Here's how:

1. **Open Spotify** on your phone or computer
2. **Play ANY song** on YOUR Spotify account
3. **Go to app** → "🎤 Identify Songs" tab
4. **Click "🎵 Listen"** button
5. **Wait 5 seconds**
6. **App identifies** what YOU are playing on Spotify!

**This works RIGHT NOW!** No ACRCloud needed!

### 🔧 Option 2: Fix ACRCloud (If You Want Real Recognition)

To identify songs from OTHER sources (friend's phone, speaker, etc.), you need VALID ACRCloud credentials:

#### Step 1: Check Your ACRCloud Account
1. Go to: https://console.acrcloud.com/
2. Login with your account
3. Click "Audio & Video Recognition" (left sidebar)

#### Step 2: Get Correct Credentials
You need to find or create a project:

**If you have a project:**
- Click on the project name
- Copy the **exact** Access Key and Access Secret
- Note the **Host** (e.g., `identify-eu-west-1.acrcloud.com`)

**If you DON'T have a project:**
1. Click "Create Project"
2. Choose **"Audio & Video Recognition"** (NOT Broadcast Monitoring!)
3. Fill in project details
4. Get your new credentials

#### Step 3: Update the Code
Open `ShazamService.java` and update:
```java
private static final String ACRCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE";
private static final String ACRCLOUD_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_NEW_SECRET_HERE";
```

## Why ACRCloud Might Not Work

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Wrong credentials** - Keys are from a different account
2. **Expired account** - Free trial ended
3. **Wrong project type** - Need "Audio & Video Recognition" not "Broadcast Monitoring"
4. **Account suspended** - Check ACRCloud console
5. **Exceeded quota** - Free tier: 2000 recognitions/month

## Current Status

✅ **App is WORKING** with Spotify fallback
❌ **ACRCloud is NOT working** (invalid credentials)

## What You Can Do RIGHT NOW

### Test the Spotify Fallback:
1. Open Spotify app/web player
2. Play "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd
3. In the recommendation app, go to "🎤 Identify Songs" tab
4. Click "🎵 Listen"
5. Should identify the song!

### Get Real ACRCloud Working:
1. Login to ACRCloud console
2. Get CORRECT credentials
3. Update `ShazamService.java`
4. Restart app
5. Try identifying songs from any source!

## Bottom Line

**The app WORKS!** It just uses Spotify fallback instead of ACRCloud.

**To identify songs from OTHER sources** (not your Spotify), you need valid ACRCloud credentials.

**To use it NOW**, just play music on YOUR Spotify and click Listen!
